# Face Recognition

The purpose of this project is to develop a face recognition system.

( TODO: Complete below with more details ...)



## 1. Description

( Describes the problem that is being solved, the source of the data, inputs, and outputs. )

## 2. Test harness

( Describes how model selection will be performed including the resampling method and model evaluation metrics. )

## 3. Baseline performance

( Describes the baseline model performance (using the test harness) that defines whether a model is skillful or not. )

## 4. Experimental Results

( Presents the experimental results, perhaps testing a suite of models, model configurations, data preparation schemes, and more. Each subsection should have some form of:
4.1 Intent: why run the experiment?
4.2 Expectations: what was the expected outcome of the experiment?
4.3 Methods: what data, models, and configurations are used in the experiment?
4.4 Results: what were the actual results of the experiment?
4.5 Findings: what do the results mean, how do they relate to expectations, what other experiments do they inspire? )

## 5. Improvements

( Describes experimental results for attempts to improve the performance of the better performing models, such as hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods. )

## 6. Final Model

( Describes the choice of a final model, including configuration and performance. It is a good idea to demonstrate saving and loading the model and demonstrate the ability to make predictions on a holdout dataset. )

## 7. Extensions

( Describes areas that were considered but not addressed in the project that could be explored in the future. )
